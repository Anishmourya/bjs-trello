git clone https://github.com/kiastorm/bjs-trello.git
yarn
yarn dev
```


## If I had more time I would work on:
- Jankiness when dropping cards
- Remove leftover dead code (Sorry! I haven't set up linting on my new machine yet)
- Add CRUD Operations for boards & lists
- Add mock async calls and error handling
- UX refinements (Using 'Enter' and 'ESC' keys)
